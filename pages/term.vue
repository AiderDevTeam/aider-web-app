          <div class="inter-font">1.1 Aider operates a platform that allows:</div>
          <div class="inter-font">(a) users to advertise items for rent (such users being "owners");</div>
          <div class="inter-font">(b) owners to communicate with and enter into agreements with other users to rent (such users that rent being "renters");</div>

          <div class="inter-font">2.1 Aider only provides a platform that enables users to rent and lend items, but does not rent or lend items itself. We also do not regularly monitor the quality of the items made available for hire by owners through the Aider Service.</div>
          <div class="inter-font">2.2 As such, the owner (and not us) is responsible for ensuring that items conform to any descriptions provided, are fit for purpose and safe to use. If you are a renter, we will not be responsible to you for any items that you hire through the Aider Service.</div>
          <div class="inter-font">2.3 If you are a owner, you will also be responsible for complying with any obligations you may have under applicable law with respect to the items that you provide for hire, including giving effect to renters' rights under applicable consumer law and compensating any damage to the renter or any other person caused by your items.</div>
          <div class="inter-font">2.4 If you are a renter, you will be responsible for the proper care and return of any items you hire through the Aider Service. You will not normally be held liable for compensating the owner for accidental loss or damage to those items unless loss or damage is the result of negligence, forgetfulness, carelessness, improper use, not having the appropriate skills or experience to operate those items, and theft. The Aider Service will determine if you are liable under these circumstances. You will be responsible for any damage you cause to other people or property when you use those items.</div>

          <div class="inter-font">9.2 You must not offer to lend through the Aider Service any firearms, weapons, pornography, mature content, animals or any items that it would be illegal to offer for hire in your or the renter's country of residence. We may remove any items offered for hire from the Aider Service if we believe such items are illegal, immoral or damaging to our reputation.</div>
          <div class="inter-font">9.3 You are responsible for ensuring that:</div>
          <div class="inter-font">(a) you have all necessary rights to hire out any items you advertise on the Aider Service, and that the renter's use of those items will not infringe any other party's rights;</div>
          <div class="inter-font">(b) you deliver any hired items to the renter in accordance with the agreement you reach with the renter;</div>
          <div class="inter-font">(c) any descriptions of the items you advertise for hire through the Aider Service are accurate and include all information relevant to the use of the item, including (as appropriate): (i) notice of any defects, restrictions or other requirements that may apply to the use of the item; and (ii) any instructions or notices that may reasonably be required to use the item safely;</div>

          <div class="inter-font">10.1 This paragraph 10 applies to you if you are a renter.</div>
          <div class="inter-font">10.2 When you agree to hire an item with an owner, the owner grants you a limited right to use that item for the relevant hire period. This right is personal to you and you are not allowed to give this right to any other person.</div>
          <div class="inter-font">10.3 You are responsible for ensuring that:</div>
          <div class="inter-font">(a) you are legally allowed to use any item that you borrow through the Aider Service;</div>
          <div class="inter-font">(b) you comply with all applicable law when using the item;</div>
          <div class="inter-font">(c) you comply with any reasonable directions provided by the owner in order to use the item safely;</div>
          <div class="inter-font">(d) you return the item in the same condition as it was in when you collected it from the owner (any reasonable wear and tear excepted).</div>
          <div class="inter-font">10.4 If you hire a storage space through the Aider Service, you must ensure that the items you store are not flammable, dangerous or hazardous to people or animals. You will be responsible for any damage caused to the storage space, the owner or any other person or property as a result of your use of any storage space you hire through the Aider Service.</div>
          <div class="inter-font">10.5 You are free to agree with the owner how you will return any items you have hired to the owner; however, you must ensure that you return any items you have hired to the owner before your hire period ends.</div>
          <div class="inter-font">10.6 You will be responsible for any loss of or damage to the item you have hired as a result of negligence, carelessness, improper use, not having the appropriate skills or experience to operate those items, and theft. The Aider Service will determine if you are liable under these circumstances. Please see paragraph 15 for more information about how we handle disputes between renters and owners, including any if the item is damaged, lost or stolen.</div>
          <div class="inter-font">10.7 You can cancel a request to borrow an item at any time before the request is accepted by the owner, or at any time up to 48 hours after the request is submitted, known as the ‘cooling off period’. There is no cooling off period if the request is within 48 hours of the start date. If you cancel before the request has been accepted, or within the cooling off period you will receive a full refund.</div>
          <div class="inter-font">10.8 If you fail to return an item by the agreed deadline you must contact the owner and or Aider to notify them as soon as you are aware you are going to miss the deadline. You will also need to book and pay for the extended time immediately. The owner may not be able to accommodate the extension in which case it is your responsibility to get the item(s) back to the owner within a timeframe that suits the owner. If you do not do so you will be liable to pay late fees(“Late Fees”) as determined to be appropriate by Aider. You agree that Aider can charge this amount from your card or bank account without further permission.</div>
          <div class="inter-font">10.9 If you miss the agreed deadline for return and are uncommunicative with the owner or Aider, or we have reason to believe you have caused damage to the item, you agree that Aider can take a holding deposit from your account up to the full value of the items you have rented (“Holding Deposit”). This deposit will be fully refundable, less any fees owed to the company or owner, once the items are returned, replaced or repaired. Otherwise the deposit will not be refunded.</div>

          <div class="inter-font">11.1 If you are an owner, we will collect the Hire Fee from the renter on your behalf. Unless we are unable to obtain payment from the renter, such as where a buyer's payment method is refused or our payment services provider determines that there is a risk of fraud, we will transfer you the Hire Fee within 23 hours of the start date of the rental. We will also charge you a fee of 24% of the Hire Fee ("owner Fee"), which we will deduct from the amount we transfer to you.</div>
          <div class="inter-font">11.2 If you are a renter, once you have agreed to hire an item from the owner, we will charge you the full Hire Fee on the owner's behalf. In addition to the Hire Fee, we will also charge you an additional fee for your use of the Aider Service equal to 24% of the price you pay to the owner to hire an item ("Renter Fee").</div>
          <div class="inter-font">11.3 If we are unsuccessful in charging the Hire Fee, Renter Fee, Late Fee, Settlement Fee or any other amount to your credit or debit card, and have still not received payment within 7 days after informing you, we may suspend or temporarily disable all or part of your access to the Aider Service (without any responsibility to you), and we shall be under no obligation to provide any or all of the Aider Service while the amount concerned is unpaid.

          <div class="inter-font">15.1 We encourage users to resolve any disputes directly. If, as a renter, you have lost or damaged an item, you are responsible for reimbursing the owner immediately for the full value of repairing the item (if possible) or replacing it.</div>
          <div class="inter-font">15.2 If you are an owner, we may ask you to provide proof of purchase, photos of any damage caused to an item, or any other evidence to support your claim for reimbursement from a renter. Where you claim that a renter has damaged an item, we may also ask you to provide photos of your item taken before it was provided to a renter, to support your claim that any damage was caused by the renter (and was not present at the start of the hire period).</div>
          <div class="inter-font">15.3 In the event that a renter and an owner are unable to resolve a dispute between them directly, they can ask us to mediate the dispute. If we do mediate a dispute, we may charge a fee of up to 30% of any amounts that we, the owner and the renter determine are payable by the renter to compensate the owner for any loss or damage to the item. We will charge this amount to the renter in addition to any amounts the renter is required to pay to the owner (together known as the “Settlement Fee”). If Aider mediates the dispute you agree to accept Aider’s conclusion and pay any amount which Aider determines you are liable for.</div>
          <div class="inter-font">15.4 If you owe Aider or another user money through the terms of these Terms of Service you agree to pay the sum promptly and not more than 48 hours from it being requested.
